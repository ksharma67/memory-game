<h1>This is a complete browser-based card matching game.</h1>

<h3>In Each turn:</h3>
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.<br>
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.<br>
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.<br>
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.<br>
